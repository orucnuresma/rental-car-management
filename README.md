# Rental Car Management System

## Overview
This project is a console-based Rental Car Management System developed in Java.  
It demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

The system models a rental company that manages different types of vehicles and customers through a structured class hierarchy.
